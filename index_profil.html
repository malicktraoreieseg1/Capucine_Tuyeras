            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>
                I am a dynamic, helpful person and always curious to learn. Thanks to the different activities practiced during my youth, I was able to acquire new skills as well as develop my sense of organization. My ability to listen and pay attention generally goes hand in hand with my dedication. Finally, my strength mainly lies on my creativity as well as my logic.

                I have loved dancing since the age of 3, I was able to do classical and contemporary dance but also tap dancing. I particularly enjoy music, and I was able to practice the trumpet, particularly in an orchestra. I couldn't live without music and dancing.
